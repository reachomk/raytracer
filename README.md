# 3D Raytraced 3D Renderer
---

This is a raytraced 3D renderer I've built as a way to solidify my C++ skills. It does not use any libraries outside of the C++ STL. It's currently a work in progress, though I hope to build on what I've made in the coming months.

At the moment, this renders spheres using ray-sphere intersections and calculating the reflective vectors using matrix multiplication. You can see an example of a rendered sphere in *img.ppm.*
